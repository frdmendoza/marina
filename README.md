# MARINA #

A Tool for Solar Radiation Series Generation
--------------------------------------------

MARINA (Multi annual radiation information approach) is a package of M-files for the calculation of solar radiation series, starting from an existing set of measurements. After the QC of measurements, TMY and similar annual condensed sequences of solar radiation can be addressed.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### Modules: ###

* To format: input data are converted into a internal structured format
* QC: as described in ...
* Validation: based in the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC).
* Candidates selection: made by standard TMY methodology (FS statistic) or, in the multi-annual approach, a sampling exercise (repeated n-times) in the normal distribution fitted to the monthly valid data month by month.
* Annual series generation: achieve specific requested monthly values from the data-bank delivered in the validation module.
* Adding meteorological data: a specific module taking into account the input meteorological data.
